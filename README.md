# Python-Pong

Building a version of the pong game in Pygame and Python.

Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created,
this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball,
the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain10 point,
a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.
The game can be played with two human players.
